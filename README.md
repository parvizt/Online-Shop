Creating a Physical Database for an Online-Offline Store Chain


Creating a Physical Database for an Online-Offline Store Chain

A friend is in the process of launching a small chain of online-offline hybrid stores and requested my assistance in setting up a SQL database. The goal is to have a database that I can later transfer and load onto a Power BI for design and execution. Additionally, there was an interest in creating the database through a user interface, and I developed it using Python. Anyway, I'll be sharing the database and a sample of the work with you, and I'll upload its data to GitHub. I hope that others can benefit from it.

The appeal of this project lies in the fact that these stores will gradually realize how having a database and a visualization software can be useful and productive for their business.
